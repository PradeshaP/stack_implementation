Overview
This C++ program implements a simple stack data structure using an array. It provides basic stack operations such as push, pop, peek, check if the stack is empty, and check if the stack is full. The program runs in a loop, allowing the user to perform multiple operations until they choose to exit.

Features
Push: Add an element to the top of the stack.
Pop: Remove the top element from the stack.
Peek: View the top element of the stack without removing it.
isEmpty: Check if the stack is empty.
isFull: Check if the stack is full.
Display: Show all elements in the stack from top to bottom.
